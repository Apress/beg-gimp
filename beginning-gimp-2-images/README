Beginning GIMP: From Novice to Professional, 2nd Edition,
by Akkana Peck.

I hope they'll be helpful in working through some of the exercises
in the book. In some cases I've provided XCF format images so you
can see the layer structure and other details of the image.

Images are organized by the chapter in which they appear most.
Some images appear in more than one chapter.
